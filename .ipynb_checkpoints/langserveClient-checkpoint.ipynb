This suggests that the motor is operating in a higher temperature environment.\\n\\n3) Motor surface temperature: The motor surface temperature during operation is 80 degrees Celsius, which exceeds the standard value of 60 degrees Celsius. This indicates that the motor is overheating.\\n\\nBased on the above analysis, the likely root cause of the unexpected shutdown of the Benchmill is inadequate cooling leading to motor overheating. \\n\\nRecommendations:\\n1) Improve the cooling mechanisms by ensuring proper airflow through the cooling vents. This can be achieved by cleaning the vents regularly and removing any obstructions.\\n\\n2) Reduce the ambient temperature around the motor by improving the ventilation in the production area or implementing additional cooling measures such as fans or air conditioning.\\n\\n3) Monitor and control the motor surface temperature during operation to ensure it stays within the standard value of 60 degrees'"
